A template for the Education Centre to run a session for students (Key Stage 3).


A step by step guide to creating a quiz based on Guardian content from the last seven days.
Using HTML, CSS and Javascript to create, populate a quiz and reflect answers.

To do
=====

-- Create Guide / Tasks (we may want to re-order this), each step should include how to 
build the HTML, CSS and JavaScript if required.

- Guide: Create the template for the quiz with one question and one answer.
- Task: Create multiple answers.
- Task: Store the correct answer to the question.
- Guide: On users answer to a question, check against the real answer and reflect back to user. 
- Guide: Document / code the steps to navigate to the next question.
- Task: Create another question with multiple answers and navigate from q1 to q2.
- Task: Create a button to navigate to previous question e.g. q2 - q1
- Task: Ensure each question can be answered and reflect the real answer to the user. 
- Guide: Using local storage to store answers for users.
- Task: Using local storage create a function to % of users who answer correctly and present it at end of the quiz.

Time dependent / extra ideas:
- How to find Guaridan content (Content API).
- Layout and templating
- How to test your quiz works as expected.

-- An easy way to present last 7 days of Guardian content to students. CAPI team created a card view of 
the Content API but this seems to have gone. Find out why or create one!

-- A list of resources that students can use should they get stuck e.g.
- https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/web/Guide/HTML/HTML5 specifically: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/Forms_in_HTML

Requirements:
- Template should be able to take home
- An easy editing tool for students to use e.g. https://github.com/adobe/brackets/wiki/How-to-Use-Brackets or Sublime Text 2.
