A template for the Education Centre to run a session for students (Key Stage 3).


A step by step guide to creating a quiz based on Guardian content from the last seven days.
Using HTML, CSS and Javascript to create, populate a quiz and reflect answers.

To do
=====

- Create Guide / Tasks (we may want to re-order this), each step should include how to 
build the HTML, CSS and JavaScript if required.

- Guide: Create the template for the quiz with one question and one answer.
- Task: Create answers.
- Task: Create another question with multiple answers 
- Task: Get users answer and check if it is correct. Show success / failure.

- Guide: Document / code the steps to navigate to the next question.
- Task: Create a button to navigate to previous question e.g. q2 - q1
- Task: Ensure each question can be answered and reflect the real answer to the user. 
- An easy way to present last 7 days of Guardian content to students. CAPI team created a card view of 
the Content API but this seems to have gone. Find out why or create one!
- A list of resources that students can use should they get stuck e.g. https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/web/Guide/HTML/HTML5 specifically: 

Time dependent / extra ideas:
- How to find Guardian content (Content API).
- Layout and templating
- How to test your quiz works as expected.
- ??

Requirements:
- Template should be able to take home
- An easy editing tool for students to use e.g. https://github.com/adobe/brackets/wiki/How-to-Use-Brackets or Sublime Text 2.
