A step by step guide to creating a quiz based on Guardian content from the last seven days.
Using HTML, CSS and Javascript to create, populate a quiz and reflect answers.

Getting started
==============

If you have Git installed you can clone this repository, alternatively you can download the repository as a zip file (it's very small).

Once you have education-centre-quiz folder locally there are just a few files to get going with this. 
`index.html` contains the basics for creating a quiz with HTML/
`quiz.html` and `quiz.js` contain the basics for creating a quiz with Javascript.

You can edit any of the three files in a text browser but a couple of tools to make the files easier to edit are listed below. Viewing `index.html` or `quiz.html` in a web browser will show the current layout.

The Education Centre will be using [Brackets](http://brackets.io/) to edit files, alternatively we recommend [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/).

Template for getting started is currently on master.
An implementation of the code can be found on this [branch](https://github.com/guardian/education-centre-quiz/compare/finished-quiz-with-extras)
